*Reflections after graduating from the University of Virginia*

I recently graduated from UVA, and over the past few weeks I have felt a quiet obligation to reflect on the lessons that emerged. Some of these lessons have been repeated countless times, while others might be more specific to my own experience. I believe there is value in both.

It is often said that college is not about education as much as it is about learning how to live. I think that is accurate. In many ways, these four years serve as a transitional state, an intentionally imperfect rehearsal for adulthood.

## 1. Time and scheduling.
Unlike high school, where your day is structured down to the minute, college hands you a blank slate. No one checks whether you attend class, eat lunch, or sleep before 4 a.m. The freedom is immediate—and initially, disorienting. My first semester became a series of experiments in self-observation: tracking energy levels, gauging my mental and physical health, and gradually learning when I function best. Once I figured out a system that worked for me, life became more predictable. Not easier, but definitely more manageable. One of the most helpful realizations was understanding whether I’m a morning person or a night person—both of which are entirely valid. For a while, I operated under the assumption that peak productivity required being a morning person. But as I learned about the schedules of people who I looked up to and compared my productivity and output to, I realized how subjective it really is. I think I heard that Demis Hassabis works best between 1 am and 4am, when the world is quiet and distractions are minimal, and as a result, he starts his day around noon. That perspective helped me reframe what "discipline" looks like, which is to try but  optimizing for your own rhythms. That said, one non-negotiable I discovered: sleep. For me, anything less than seven hours means the rest of the day is running on borrowed time.

## 2. Ignore noise. Optimize slowly.  
College, especially early on, can feel like a race. Everyone seems to have a plan. The pressure to pick a field, get into the right clubs, and land the most prestigious internships starts almost immediately. But from what I have noticed, the my peers who seemed the most confident by graduation weren’t the ones who sprinted toward something. They were the ones who eased in, took time to explore, and allowed themselves space to think critically about what actually interested them. My advice: treat the first year as a tasting menu. Spend time “sampling” different areas of study while keeping a few core skills sharp. Skills like writing, coding, public speaking, and people skills are portable and can be applied across many disciplines. Keeping those in good shape will ensure you never feel completely behind, even while you’re still figuring out what direction to take.

## 3. Mentor.
Mentorship has become something of a buzzword, but its value is real. Having someone a few steps ahead of you, whether it is an upperclassman, a PhD student, or a professor, can make a real difference in how you navigate your time. They help you reason through decisions, avoid inefficient paths, and offer a clearer view of what lies ahead based on where they have already been.
I tend to think of life as a kind of traversal problem. Everyone is moving through their own branching structure, and while no single path works for everyone, talking to those further along helps you avoid revisiting the same subtrees. Mentors offer insight into which directions led to meaningful experiences, which ones felt like dead ends, and which unexplored routes might be worth revisiting. The thing is that these relationships take effort. You have to give someone a reason to invest in you.
In my experience, asking good questions, being open about your uncertainty, and approaching conversations with genuine curiosity helped build trust. Mentorship is not something you are simply given. It grows through effort and mutual interest.
From a practical standpoint, it is also important to have two or three people who know you well and can vouch for you when it matters. Whether or not you are headed toward academia, having those references in your corner can quietly open more doors than you might expect.

## 4. Cohort. 
In tangent to that point, find a cohort. A group of people who share similar values and goals can help keep you accountable and push you to grow. It can also be beneficial to include people with different viewpoints, since a mix of perspectives often leads to deeper understanding. Going back to the tree metaphor, if you are all traversing toward similar goals at the same time, you can learn from each other's mistakes and adjust your own approach accordingly. Collaborating in this way creates a system where everyone gets better. There are many ways to find this kind of group. Clubs, classes, research teams, or even online platforms can serve as starting points. It does not have to be limited to people at your school or in your grade. I found some sick people through Discord who shared my interests, and none of them went to UVA.

## Learning in class.
Recorded lectures are great. If a class is being recorded and the lecture is large enough that you cannot ask questions during class, I usually find it more effective to just watch the recording instead. In many of these massive lectures, the lines to speak with the professor afterward are long, and the setting itself is not built for interaction. Watching the recording gives you full control. My method is to have the lecture on one screen and your LLM of choice on another. You can give the model the content or context of the class, pause the lecture whenever something is unclear, and use the model to explore your confusion. Language models have gotten good enough that the answers you get are often quite reliable and detailed.
As a separate point, I highly recommend enrolling in smaller, more intimate classes when possible. These tend to be higher level courses, and the professors leading them are often more specialized and open to deeper questions. In my experience, these classes also tend to have fewer filler assignments and more opportunities for real engagement with the material.

## 7. Physical exercise.
Allot some time for exercise. There is a beauty in physical activity, and for me, it became a necessary break from the constant noise and stress that comes with college life. When I go to the gym, play a sport, or go for a run, the only thing on my mind is the activity itself. It creates a space where everything else fades into the background. There is something deeply satisfying about the adrenaline that comes from pushing your body and focusing completely on the moment. I honestly believe that without at least an hour of physical activity each day, I would have burned out completely. It gave me structure, clarity, and a way to reset when everything else felt chaotic.
