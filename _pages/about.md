Hi, I'm Varun, an undergraduate Computer Science major at the University of Virginia. I am a researcher in the <a href='https://engineering.virginia.edu/labs-groups/link-lab'>Link Lab</a>, working with <a href='https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/laura-barnes'>Laura Barnes</a> and <a href='https://yenlingkuo.com/'>Yen-Ling Kuo</a>.

I am interested in the intersection of human cognition and machine learning, aiming to develop systems that emulate the efficiency and adaptability of human learning. I explore this through areas such as machine perception, reinforcement learning, and neurosymbolic AI. I believe that deepening our computational understanding of intelligence will be instrumental in unlocking solutions to humanity's most complex and pressing issues.

In my free time, I enjoy playing/watching football (soccer), tennis, and chess. I also like to think/read about philisophy, specifically futurology.
