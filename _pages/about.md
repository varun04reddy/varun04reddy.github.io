Hi, I'm Varun, a Computer Science major at the University of Virginia.

I am interested in natural language processing, machine learning, and generative modeling. Recently, I have been exploring research questions such as:
- What approaches can be used to create generative models that understand and emulate skills innate to humans, such as creativity and problem-solving abilities?
- How can we leverage ML methods to address real-world problems with broad social impacts, focusing on creating robust and fair solutions? 
- What methods can be used to create adaptive learning systems that can operate in dynamic and uncertain environments
