I’m interested in how we can build intelligent systems that learn to [think](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/critical-thinking/#CompProc) about the world and reason about themselves, while understanding their learning representations and circuits.

I'm currently exploring this at [Harvard Kempner Institute](https://kempnerinstitute.harvard.edu/) under [Bernardo Sabatini](https://sabatini.hms.harvard.edu/). Previously, I was an undergraduate at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/) studying Computer Science in the School of Engineering, where I worked with [Yen-Ling Kuo](https://yenlingkuo.com/) and [Laura Barnes](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/laura-barnes).


We study our own intelligence from the top down and build artificial intelligence from the bottom up; somewhere in the middle, the two approaches meet to teach us about both.
