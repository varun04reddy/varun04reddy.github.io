Hi, I'm Varun, an undergraduate Computer Science major at the University of Virginia. I am a researcher in the <a href='https://engineering.virginia.edu/labs-groups/link-lab'>Link Lab</a>, advised by <a href='https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/laura-barnes'>Laura Barnes</a>

I am broadly interested in natural language processing, machine learning, and generative modeling. Recently, I have been exploring research questions such as:

- Can we apply our understanding of the human mind to create generative models that understand and emulate skills innate to humans, such as creativity and intuition?
- How can we leverage ML methods to address real-world problems with broad social impacts, focusing on creating robust and fair solutions?
- Can we create adaptive learning systems that can operate in dynamic and uncertain environments?
