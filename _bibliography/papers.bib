  abstract  = {Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong performance
on factual recall and general reasoning but struggle to adapt to user-
specific, commonsense knowledge, a challenge particularly acute in small-
parameter settings where computational efficiency is prioritized. We in-
troduce CaseEdit , a new dataset and generation pipeline for evaluating
localized, personalized commonsense knowledge editing in small LLMs to
address this. Built upon the ATOMIC20/20 commonsense graph, CaseEdit
uses a multi-stage inference process to generate both typical and atypi-
cal contextual edits for household objects, paired with targeted evaluation
questions across four axes: reliability, generalization, locality, and portabil-
ity. We evaluate established knowledge editing methods using CaseEdit
and demonstrate that AlphaEdit, a technique employing null-space projec-
tion to minimize interference with unrelated knowledge, consistently out-
performs other methods when applied to an LLaMA 3.2 3B model, even
in scalability tests, showing minimal ripple effects. Our results indicate
that using CaseEdit with effective editing techniques like AlphaEdit al-
lows small models to internalize high-quality, context-sensitive common-
sense knowledge, paving the way for lightweight, personalized assistants.},

  abstract={
  During social interactions, understanding the intricacies of the context can be vital, particularly for socially anxious individuals. While previous research has found that the presence of a social interaction can be detected from ambient audio, the nuances within social contexts, which influence how anxiety provoking interactions are, remain largely unexplored. As an alternative to traditional, burdensome methods like self-report, this study presents a novel approach that harnesses ambient audio segments to detect social threat contexts. We focus on two key dimensions: number of interaction partners (dyadic vs. group) and degree of evaluative threat (explicitly evaluative vs. not explicitly evaluative). Building on data from a Zoom-based social interaction study (N=52 college students, of whom the majority N=45 are socially anxious), we employ deep learning methods to achieve strong detection performance. Under sample-wide 5-fold Cross Validation (CV), our model distinguished dyadic from group interactions with 90\% accuracy and detected evaluative threat at 83\%. Using a leave-one-group-out CV, accuracies were 82\% and 77\%, respectively. While our data are based on virtual interactions due to pandemic constraints, our method has the potential to extend to diverse real-world settings. This research underscores the potential of passive sensing and AI to differentiate intricate social contexts, and may ultimately advance the ability of context-aware digital interventions to offer personalized mental health support.
